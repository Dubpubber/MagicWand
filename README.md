# Project Purpose
I felt that users wouldn't want to download DManager, the larger cousin of MagicWand. MagicWand simply serves as a barebones, easy and clean spell finder for quickly searching for Dungeons and Dragons spells. Using SQLite, users will be able to narrow down spells based on spell name, spell school, spell supporting classes, spell components and spell level. After selecting a spell from the table, the user will be provided with detailed information including the spell's specific formatted description. This tool is essential for new and seasoned dungeon masters looking to keep the campaign rolling quickly.
# Project Authors
My name is Tyler Crowe, I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I try to put aside time every week specifically for creating to further grow my skills. I've been programming for about 8 years now and have no plans on stopping now!
